# Clue-bot  
A simple oldschool runescape clue-simulator in the form of a subreddit bot!  


### Usage  
Simply comment the specific invokation call and the bot will reply after a few seconds (Refreshing the page may be required)
You can try it out in the ~~[2007scape](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/)~~ (Got banned because people started using it to hijack other threads) [2007scape_cluebot](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape_cluebot/) subreddit.  

Invoke the bot on a specific level:

`clue-bot(hard);`  
`clue-bot(easy);`


### WIP  
Only hard clues are implemented so far. It took some time to find a decent item-to-ID for usage with the GE API, and even then, it was outdated.  

The items_ID.JSON file is in the repository and was most likely made around mid-2016 and the game has obviously progressed a lot since then so some things will have to be manually added.


#### Examples
